#To execute a Bash script file, follow these steps

Create a Bash script file:
Write your Bash script in a text editor (such as nano, vim, or gedit) and save it with a .sh extension, for example script.sh.

Give execute permissions:
Before running the script, you need to give it execute permissions. This can be done using the chmod command:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x script.sh
Run the script:
Once the script has execute permissions, you can run it by typing:

bash
Copy code
./script.sh
Alternatively, you can use the bash command to run the script:

bash
Copy code
bash script.sh
(Optional) Specify interpreter (shebang):
At the top of your script, include a shebang line to indicate the interpreter to be used. For Bash, it looks like this:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
This line tells the system that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.

By following these steps, your Bash script will be executed on the system.
