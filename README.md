# Summary of Bash Script

Bash scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks in Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS. A Bash script is essentially a sequence of commands written in the Bash shell, saved in a file with a .sh extension, that can be executed to perform various tasks. These scripts help automate repetitive tasks, manage system operations, and simplify complex processes like file manipulation, system monitoring, and software installation.

Bash scripting is versatile and supports conditional statements (if-else), loops (for, while), functions, and variables, allowing developers to build complex workflows. It's often used in system administration for tasks like backups, managing log files, and user account handling. Additionally, scripts can interact with other programs and commands, making them useful for tasks like network management, disk usage monitoring, or package installation.

Since Bash is typically pre-installed on most Unix-based systems, it's widely accessible and used across various fields, from development and DevOps to cybersecurity. Writing Bash scripts requires knowledge of the command-line interface and the ability to combine commands logically. Itâ€™s an essential skill for anyone working in system administration or Linux environments.

### What is Bash Scripting?
Bash scripting is a powerful way to automate tasks and manage system operations in Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS. A Bash script is essentially a sequence of shell commands that are saved in a file, typically with a .sh extension. When executed, the script runs all the commands in sequence, allowing users to automate repetitive tasks, create complex workflows, and manage system resources efficiently.
### Common Applications of Bash Scripts:
1. Automation:
  Bash scripts are widely used to automate repetitive tasks like file backups, server monitoring, and software deployment.

2. System Administration:
  System administrators use Bash scripts to manage user accounts, monitor disk usage, automate updates, and manage network configurations.

3. Data Processing:
  Bash scripts are also useful in processing text files, generating reports, and managing large datasets by leveraging Unix text processing commands like awk, sed, and grep.

4. DevOps and CI/CD Pipelines:
  Bash scripts play a vital role in DevOps pipelines for automating deployments, configuring environments, and running tests.

5. Task Scheduling:
  With tools like cron, Bash scripts can be scheduled to run at specific times or intervals, making them ideal for automated tasks like system maintenance, backups, or periodic checks.

### Dependencies:
Before using a Bash script, there are a few dependencies to consider:

1. Bash Shell:
  Bash is the default shell in most Linux distributions and macOS, so it's typically available out-of-the-box. To check the Bash version on your system, use:
  ```bash
bash --version
```
2. System Utilities:
  Many Bash scripts rely on Unix utilities like grep, awk, sed, ls, and df. These utilities are pre-installed on most systems, but some scripts might require installing additional tools.For example, if you're writing a script to send emails, you'll need to install mailutils:
  ```bash
sudo apt install mailutils  # For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo yum install mailx      # For CentOS/RHEL
```
3. File Permissions:
  For a Bash script to execute, it must have execute permissions. This can be set with the chmod command:
 ```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```
### How Bash Scripts Work:
1. Script Structure:
  A Bash script starts with the shebang line #!/bin/bash, which tells the system that the script should be executed with the Bash shell. Without the shebang, the script may not execute     correctly, especially if it's run in a different shell environment.
2. Variables:
  Variables are used to store data. In Bash, variables can store strings, numbers, or command output:
 ```bash
name="John"
echo "Hello, $name"
```
  You can also capture command outputs into variables:
 ```bash
current_date=$(date)
echo "Today's date is: $current_date"
```
3. Control Flow (if/else, loops):
   Bash supports control flow structures such as if-else statements and loops. These are crucial for decision-making and repeating tasks within scripts.
   Example: Checking disk space:
```bash
if [ $(df / | grep / | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//g') -gt 80 ]; then
    echo "Disk space is running low!"
fi
```
  Example: Looping through files:
```bash
for file in *.txt; do
    echo "Processing $file"
done
```
4. Functions:
   Functions allow you to encapsulate a series of commands into a reusable block, making your scripts more modular and readable.
```bash
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}

greet "Alice"
```
5. Error Handling:
  Bash has built-in mechanisms for error handling using exit statuses. Every command returns an exit status, where 0 means success and non-zero indicates failure. You can capture these statuses and handle errors gracefully:
```bash
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Command failed"
    exit 1
fi
```
6. Input and Output:
  Bash scripts can accept user input using the read command, and output can be written to files using redirection (> for overwrite, >> for append):
```bash
read -p "Enter your name: " user_name
echo "Welcome, $user_name!" > welcome.txt
```
7. Scheduling with Cron:
  To run a Bash script automatically at specific times, you can use cron. For example, to run a backup script every day at 2 AM, add it to crontab:
```bash
0 2 * * * /path/to/backup_script.sh
```
### Key Advantages of Bash Scripts:

1. Ease of Use:
  Bash scripting is relatively easy to learn, especially for those familiar with the Unix/Linux command line. It allows quick automation of everyday tasks without the need for complex     programming languages.

2. Portability:
  Bash scripts are portable across different Unix-based systems. As long as the system supports Bash, the same script can run on different Linux distributions or macOS without       modification.

3. Efficiency:
  Automating tasks with Bash can save time and reduce human error, particularly for repetitive tasks like system updates, backups, and server monitoring.

4.Integration with Other Tools:
  Bash scripts can easily integrate with other programming languages, tools, or system commands, making it a flexible tool for both simple and complex tasks.

## Conclusion:
Bash scripting is an indispensable tool for anyone working with Unix-based systems. Whether you're a system administrator managing resources, a developer automating tests, or a DevOps engineer maintaining pipelines, Bash scripting can significantly improve efficiency. With a combination of built-in commands, loops, and control flow, you can automate almost any task, saving time and minimizing errors. Understanding the basics of Bash and knowing how to leverage its power is essential for working in Linux environments.

## Bash Scripts

1. [linux_details.sh](Script/linux_details.sh): This Bash script displays the number of online users, their access groups, the Linux version, and the system's uptime. It uses commands like who, groups, lsb_release, and uptime to gather and present this information in a readable format.

<details>
<summary>Analysis of the Bash Script</summary>
This script is designed to provide essential information about the system and logged-in users. It retrieves data on online users, user access levels, Linux version, and system uptime. Below is a detailed breakdown of its functionality and use cases.
  
## How the Script Works:

1. Number of Online Users:
  
```bash
echo "Number of online users:"
who | wc -l
```
  The who command lists all currently logged-in users.
  wc -l counts the number of lines produced by the who command, which corresponds to the number of logged-in users.
  Purpose: This part shows how many users are currently logged into the system. This can be useful for administrators to monitor system access.
  
2. Access Types of Users:
  ```bash
echo -e "\nAccess types of users:"
for user in $(who | awk '{print $1}'); do
    echo "$user: $(groups $user | awk -F: '{print $2}')"
done
```
  First, the who command retrieves the list of users currently logged in, and awk '{print $1}' extracts the usernames.
  For each user, groups $user is executed to show which groups the user belongs to, revealing their access types. This command helps determine the privileges or roles of the user in the   system.
  Purpose: Displays the access level (groups) for each logged-in user. It is useful for checking user permissions and access control.
  
3. Linux Version:
```bash
echo -e "\nLinux version:"
lsb_release -a
```
  The lsb_release -a command shows detailed information about the Linux distribution, including the distribution name, version, and codename.
  Purpose: Displays the version and release information of the Linux distribution. This is important for understanding the environment the system is running on, particularly when       diagnosing system issues or performing updates.

4. System Uptime:
```bash
echo -e "\nSystem uptime:"
uptime -p
```
The uptime -p command shows how long the system has been running in a user-friendly format (e.g., "up 3 days, 4 hours").
Purpose: Displays how long the system has been running since the last reboot. It is important for system administrators to monitor system stability and decide if a reboot is necessary after long periods of uptime.

## How It Works Together:

The script is sequential and performs the following tasks:
1. Retrieves the number of users logged in.
2. Identifies which groups these users belong to, providing insight into their access rights.
3. Displays the current version of the Linux distribution, useful for maintaining or troubleshooting.
4. Displays the current version of the Linux distribution, useful for maintaining or troubleshooting.
   
Each section of the script is executed one after another, providing a concise summary of the systemâ€™s current status.

## Use Cases:
1. System Monitoring:
   System administrators can use this script to quickly gather key system information and user activity. Knowing how many users are logged in, what their access rights are, and how long the system has been running can help in managing and securing the system.
   
2. Security Audits:
   The access control section (groups of users) can help in security audits, where admins need to verify that the right users have the correct permissions.

3. Troubleshooting:
   When troubleshooting issues that may be related to system uptime or specific Linux versions, this script helps provide immediate context about the environment.

4. User Management:
   It helps administrators monitor logged-in users and ensure that only authorized users are accessing the system.

## Conclusion:
This Bash script is a useful tool for gathering essential system and user information. It automates the process of retrieving logged-in users, their access levels, the system's version, and uptime, making it a simple yet powerful script for system administrators. You can use it during routine checks, security audits, or whenever system information is required for troubleshooting or maintenance.
