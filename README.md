# Summary of Bash Script

Bash scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks in Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS. A Bash script is essentially a sequence of commands written in the Bash shell, saved in a file with a .sh extension, that can be executed to perform various tasks. These scripts help automate repetitive tasks, manage system operations, and simplify complex processes like file manipulation, system monitoring, and software installation.

Bash scripting is versatile and supports conditional statements (if-else), loops (for, while), functions, and variables, allowing developers to build complex workflows. It's often used in system administration for tasks like backups, managing log files, and user account handling. Additionally, scripts can interact with other programs and commands, making them useful for tasks like network management, disk usage monitoring, or package installation.

Since Bash is typically pre-installed on most Unix-based systems, it's widely accessible and used across various fields, from development and DevOps to cybersecurity. Writing Bash scripts requires knowledge of the command-line interface and the ability to combine commands logically. Itâ€™s an essential skill for anyone working in system administration or Linux environments.

### What is Bash Scripting?
Bash scripting is a powerful way to automate tasks and manage system operations in Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS. A Bash script is essentially a sequence of shell commands that are saved in a file, typically with a .sh extension. When executed, the script runs all the commands in sequence, allowing users to automate repetitive tasks, create complex workflows, and manage system resources efficiently.
### Common Applications of Bash Scripts:
1. Automation:
  Bash scripts are widely used to automate repetitive tasks like file backups, server monitoring, and software deployment.

2. System Administration:
  System administrators use Bash scripts to manage user accounts, monitor disk usage, automate updates, and manage network configurations.

3. Data Processing:
  Bash scripts are also useful in processing text files, generating reports, and managing large datasets by leveraging Unix text processing commands like awk, sed, and grep.

4. DevOps and CI/CD Pipelines:
  Bash scripts play a vital role in DevOps pipelines for automating deployments, configuring environments, and running tests.

5. Task Scheduling:
  With tools like cron, Bash scripts can be scheduled to run at specific times or intervals, making them ideal for automated tasks like system maintenance, backups, or periodic checks.

### Dependencies:
Before using a Bash script, there are a few dependencies to consider:

1. Bash Shell:
  Bash is the default shell in most Linux distributions and macOS, so it's typically available out-of-the-box. To check the Bash version on your system, use:
  ```bash
bash --version
```
2. System Utilities:
  Many Bash scripts rely on Unix utilities like grep, awk, sed, ls, and df. These utilities are pre-installed on most systems, but some scripts might require installing additional tools.For example, if you're writing a script to send emails, you'll need to install mailutils:
  ```bash
sudo apt install mailutils  # For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo yum install mailx      # For CentOS/RHEL
```
3. File Permissions:
  For a Bash script to execute, it must have execute permissions. This can be set with the chmod command:
 ```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```
### How Bash Scripts Work:
1. Script Structure:
  A Bash script starts with the shebang line #!/bin/bash, which tells the system that the script should be executed with the Bash shell. Without the shebang, the script may not execute     correctly, especially if it's run in a different shell environment.
2. Variables:
  Variables are used to store data. In Bash, variables can store strings, numbers, or command output:
 ```bash
name="John"
echo "Hello, $name"
```
  You can also capture command outputs into variables:
 ```bash
current_date=$(date)
echo "Today's date is: $current_date"
```
3. Control Flow (if/else, loops):
   Bash supports control flow structures such as if-else statements and loops. These are crucial for decision-making and repeating tasks within scripts.
   Example: Checking disk space:
```bash
if [ $(df / | grep / | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//g') -gt 80 ]; then
    echo "Disk space is running low!"
fi
```
  Example: Looping through files:
```bash
for file in *.txt; do
    echo "Processing $file"
done
```
4. Functions:
   Functions allow you to encapsulate a series of commands into a reusable block, making your scripts more modular and readable.
```bash
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}

greet "Alice"
```
5. Error Handling:
  Bash has built-in mechanisms for error handling using exit statuses. Every command returns an exit status, where 0 means success and non-zero indicates failure. You can capture these statuses and handle errors gracefully:
```bash
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Command failed"
    exit 1
fi
```
6. Input and Output:
  Bash scripts can accept user input using the read command, and output can be written to files using redirection (> for overwrite, >> for append):
```bash
read -p "Enter your name: " user_name
echo "Welcome, $user_name!" > welcome.txt
```
7. Scheduling with Cron:
  To run a Bash script automatically at specific times, you can use cron. For example, to run a backup script every day at 2 AM, add it to crontab:
```bash
0 2 * * * /path/to/backup_script.sh
```
### Key Advantages of Bash Scripts:

1. Ease of Use:
  Bash scripting is relatively easy to learn, especially for those familiar with the Unix/Linux command line. It allows quick automation of everyday tasks without the need for complex     programming languages.

2. Portability:
  Bash scripts are portable across different Unix-based systems. As long as the system supports Bash, the same script can run on different Linux distributions or macOS without       modification.

3. Efficiency:
  Automating tasks with Bash can save time and reduce human error, particularly for repetitive tasks like system updates, backups, and server monitoring.

4.Integration with Other Tools:
  Bash scripts can easily integrate with other programming languages, tools, or system commands, making it a flexible tool for both simple and complex tasks.

## Conclusion:
Bash scripting is an indispensable tool for anyone working with Unix-based systems. Whether you're a system administrator managing resources, a developer automating tests, or a DevOps engineer maintaining pipelines, Bash scripting can significantly improve efficiency. With a combination of built-in commands, loops, and control flow, you can automate almost any task, saving time and minimizing errors. Understanding the basics of Bash and knowing how to leverage its power is essential for working in Linux environments.

## Bash Scripts

1. [linux_details.sh](Script/linux_details.sh): This Bash script displays the number of online users, their access groups, the Linux version, and the system's uptime. It uses commands like who, groups, lsb_release, and uptime to gather and present this information in a readable format.

<details>
<summary>Analysis of the Bash Script</summary>
This script is designed to provide essential information about the system and logged-in users. It retrieves data on online users, user access levels, Linux version, and system uptime. Below is a detailed breakdown of its functionality and use cases.
  
## How the Script Works:

1. Number of Online Users:
  
```bash
echo "Number of online users:"
who | wc -l
```
  The who command lists all currently logged-in users.
  wc -l counts the number of lines produced by the who command, which corresponds to the number of logged-in users.
  Purpose: This part shows how many users are currently logged into the system. This can be useful for administrators to monitor system access.
  
2. Access Types of Users:
  ```bash
echo -e "\nAccess types of users:"
for user in $(who | awk '{print $1}'); do
    echo "$user: $(groups $user | awk -F: '{print $2}')"
done
```
  First, the who command retrieves the list of users currently logged in, and awk '{print $1}' extracts the usernames.
  For each user, groups $user is executed to show which groups the user belongs to, revealing their access types. This command helps determine the privileges or roles of the user in the   system.
  Purpose: Displays the access level (groups) for each logged-in user. It is useful for checking user permissions and access control.
  
3. Linux Version:
```bash
echo -e "\nLinux version:"
lsb_release -a
```
  The lsb_release -a command shows detailed information about the Linux distribution, including the distribution name, version, and codename.
  Purpose: Displays the version and release information of the Linux distribution. This is important for understanding the environment the system is running on, particularly when       diagnosing system issues or performing updates.

4. System Uptime:
```bash
echo -e "\nSystem uptime:"
uptime -p
```
The uptime -p command shows how long the system has been running in a user-friendly format (e.g., "up 3 days, 4 hours").
Purpose: Displays how long the system has been running since the last reboot. It is important for system administrators to monitor system stability and decide if a reboot is necessary after long periods of uptime.

## How It Works Together:

The script is sequential and performs the following tasks:
1. Retrieves the number of users logged in.
2. Identifies which groups these users belong to, providing insight into their access rights.
3. Displays the current version of the Linux distribution, useful for maintaining or troubleshooting.
4. Displays the current version of the Linux distribution, useful for maintaining or troubleshooting.
   
Each section of the script is executed one after another, providing a concise summary of the systemâ€™s current status.

## Use Cases:
1. System Monitoring:
   System administrators can use this script to quickly gather key system information and user activity. Knowing how many users are logged in, what their access rights are, and how long the system has been running can help in managing and securing the system.
   
2. Security Audits:
   The access control section (groups of users) can help in security audits, where admins need to verify that the right users have the correct permissions.

3. Troubleshooting:
   When troubleshooting issues that may be related to system uptime or specific Linux versions, this script helps provide immediate context about the environment.

4. User Management:
   It helps administrators monitor logged-in users and ensure that only authorized users are accessing the system.

## Conclusion:
This Bash script is a useful tool for gathering essential system and user information. It automates the process of retrieving logged-in users, their access levels, the system's version, and uptime, making it a simple yet powerful script for system administrators. You can use it during routine checks, security audits, or whenever system information is required for troubleshooting or maintenance.

2. [check_internet.sh](Script/check_internet.sh): This Bash script checks internet connectivity by pinging Google's server (google.com). If the ping is successful, it prints "You are connected to the internet"; otherwise, it prints "You are not connected to the internet."

<details>
<summary>Analysis of the Bash Script</summary>
This Bash script is designed to check the internet connection by pinging a specific website (in this case, google.com). It uses the ping command to determine whether the computer is connected to the internet. Below is an explanation of how the script works and its potential use cases.

## How the Script Works:
1. Setting the Target:
 ```bash
TARGET="google.com"
```
The variable TARGET is assigned the value "google.com". This is the domain that the script will attempt to ping to check the internet connection.
Purpose: This defines the website the script will use as a reference to determine internet connectivity. Google.com is chosen here because it is a reliable, well-known site that is rarely down.

2. Pinging the Target:
 ```bash
ping -c 1 $TARGET &> /dev/null
```
The ping command sends a small packet of data to the specified target (google.com) to check if the system can reach it.
The -c 1 option limits the ping to only one packet, meaning it will send just one ping request and wait for a response.
The &> /dev/null part suppresses the output, sending both standard output and error messages to /dev/null, so the user doesnâ€™t see the details of the ping operation.
Purpose: This is the core of the script, where the actual connectivity test happens. If the system can successfully ping Google, it means the internet is working.

3. Checking the Ping Status:
 ```bash
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
```
The $? variable holds the exit status of the last executed command (in this case, the ping command). If the command succeeds, $? will be 0, indicating success. If it fails (e.g., no internet connection), $? will be a non-zero value.
The script checks whether the last command (ping) was successful by comparing $? to 0.
Purpose: This checks if the ping was successful, meaning the target (Google) responded, and hence, the internet connection is active.

4. Displaying the Result:
 ```bash
echo "You are connected to the internet."
```
If the ping was successful (i.e., the exit status is 0), the script prints the message: "You are connected to the internet."
If the ping fails (i.e., the exit status is not 0), the script executes the else block:
 ```bash
echo "You are not connected to the internet."
```
Purpose: This provides user feedback on whether the system is connected to the internet or not.

## Use Cases:
1. Checking Internet Connectivity:
   This script is useful for quickly determining if a system has internet access. It can be used as part of a larger automation or monitoring system that needs to verify the network status before performing tasks like downloading files or accessing remote servers.

2. Troubleshooting Network Issues:
   If you're experiencing issues with accessing online resources, running this script can help confirm whether the problem is related to your internet connection. It can tell you if the system itself is unable to reach external sites.

3. Server Monitoring:
  This script can be integrated into monitoring systems to regularly check if servers are connected to the internet. It can help ensure that servers are reachable from the outside, allowing administrators to take action if a connection is lost

4. Automation:
   Before running tasks that require internet access (e.g., software updates, downloading files, connecting to APIs), this script can be used to verify connectivity and avoid running tasks when offline.

## Conclusion:
This Bash script is a simple yet effective way to check internet connectivity by pinging a reliable external website like google.com. By monitoring the exit status of the ping command, the script can determine whether the system is online or offline and provide feedback to the user. It can be useful in a variety of scenarios, from troubleshooting network issues to ensuring that servers or systems are properly connected to the internet.

3. [auto_ftp_upload.sh](Script/auto_ftp_upload.sh):This script automates the process of uploading files from a local directory to a specified FTP server. It connects to the FTP server using the provided credentials, uploads all files from the local directory, and logs the process in a log file for tracking purposes.

<details>
<summary>Analysis of the Bash Script</summary>
  
## Automated File Upload to an FTP Server
This Bash script is designed to automate the process of uploading files from a local directory to a remote FTP server. It uses the ftp command to establish a connection, authenticate with the server, and transfer files. Below is a breakdown of how the script works and its practical use cases.

## How the Script Works:
1. Setting FTP Server Details:
 ```bash
FTP_SERVER="ftp.example.com"   # Replace with your FTP server address
FTP_USERNAME="your_username"   # Replace with your FTP username
FTP_PASSWORD="your_password"   # Replace with your FTP password
FTP_DIRECTORY="/upload"        # Directory on the FTP server to upload files
```
These variables hold essential details for connecting to the FTP server:
FTP_SERVER: The address of the FTP server (e.g., ftp.example.com).
FTP_USERNAME and FTP_PASSWORD: The credentials for logging into the FTP server.
FTP_DIRECTORY: The directory on the FTP server where the files will be uploaded.
Purpose: These variables store the information required to authenticate and upload files to the specified FTP server.

2. Local Directory for Files:
 ```bash
LOCAL_DIRECTORY="/path/to/files"   # Replace with the path to your local directory
```
This specifies the local directory on your system where the files to be uploaded are located.
Purpose: This allows the script to know which files from your system should be uploaded to the FTP server.

3. Log File for Upload Status:
 ```bash
LOG_FILE="ftp_upload.log"
```
The log file is used to record the output and status of the FTP upload operation. This is useful for tracking whether the upload was successful or if there were any issues.
Purpose: Keeping a log file ensures that you have a record of the upload process for troubleshooting or verification.

4. The upload_files Function:
 ```bash
upload_files() {
    echo "Starting upload to FTP server: $FTP_SERVER"
    
    # Connect to the FTP server and upload files
    ftp -inv $FTP_SERVER <<EOF
user $FTP_USERNAME $FTP_PASSWORD
cd $FTP_DIRECTORY
lcd $LOCAL_DIRECTORY
mput *
bye
EOF

    echo "Upload completed. Check $LOG_FILE for details."
}
```
The upload_files function is the main part of the script that handles the file upload process.
The ftp -inv $FTP_SERVER command:
-i: Disables interactive prompting (i.e., auto-confirm actions like file overwrites).
-n: Prevents auto-login; instead, the script manually provides credentials.
-v: Enables verbose mode, which provides detailed output (which will be logged).
Inside the EOF block:
user $FTP_USERNAME $FTP_PASSWORD: Logs into the FTP server using the provided credentials.
cd $FTP_DIRECTORY: Changes to the specified directory on the FTP server.
lcd $LOCAL_DIRECTORY: Changes to the specified local directory where the files are located.
mput *: Uploads all files from the local directory to the FTP server.
bye: Closes the FTP session.
Purpose: This function automates the file transfer by logging into the FTP server, navigating to the correct directories, and uploading all files in one go.

5. Running the Function and Logging:
 ```bash
upload_files | tee $LOG_FILE
```
The upload_files function is called, and its output is piped to the tee command. The tee command writes the output to both the terminal (so you can see it in real time) and the log file (ftp_upload.log).
Purpose: This ensures that the script's status is both displayed and logged for future reference.

## Use Cases:
1. Automating Regular FTP Uploads:
  This script is perfect for automating the regular upload of files to an FTP server. For instance, businesses that need to update their website, share files with clients, or backup       data to a remote server can benefit from running this script on a scheduled basis (e.g., with cron).

2. Batch File Upload:
  Instead of manually uploading files one by one through an FTP client, this script allows for batch uploads of all files from a designated folder. This is useful in scenarios where       multiple files need to be transferred regularly.

3. Backup Systems:
  This script can be integrated into backup routines, where files or folders from a local system are automatically uploaded to a remote FTP server for storage and safekeeping.

4. Continuous File Transfer:
  For environments that require frequent file exchanges, such as data processing pipelines or content publishing systems, this script can streamline the process by eliminating the need   for manual FTP transfers.

5. Simplified File Transfer for Non-Technical Users:
  Users who arenâ€™t comfortable with FTP clients can use this script by simply running it to transfer files. The script handles all the FTP commands, making it user-friendly

## Conclusion:
This Bash script provides a streamlined and automated method for uploading files from a local directory to a remote FTP server. It handles authentication, file transfers, and logs the results for easy monitoring. The script can be particularly useful for automating repetitive tasks such as backups, regular file uploads, or continuous data exchanges between a local system and an FTP server.

4. [cleanup_temp_cache.sh](Script/cleanup_temp_cache.sh):This script removes temporary files from /tmp, clears the system cache, and deletes user-specific cache files in ~/.cache. It helps free up space and improve system performance by cleaning unnecessary files and caches.

<details>
<summary>Analysis of the Bash Script</summary>
  
## Cleaning Temporary Files and Cache
This Bash script is designed to clean different types of cache and temporary files on a Linux system. The script helps free up disk space and potentially improves system performance by removing unneeded files. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works and when it might be useful.

## How the Script Works:
1. Cleaning Temporary Files:
 ```bash
clean_temp_files() {
    echo "Cleaning temporary files..."
    rm -rf /tmp/*
    echo "Temporary files cleaned."
}
```
This function deletes all files within the /tmp/ directory, which is typically used for storing temporary files by various applications.
The command rm -rf /tmp/*:
rm -rf: Recursively removes files and directories without prompting for confirmation (the -f flag is for "force").
/tmp/*: Targets everything inside the /tmp/ directory.
Purpose: Cleans out temporary files that are no longer needed. Temporary files can accumulate over time, wasting disk space.

2. Cleaning System Cache:
 ```bash
clean_system_cache() {
    echo "Cleaning system cache..."
    sync; echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
    echo "System cache cleaned."
}
```
This function clears the system's memory cache, which includes filesystem caches.
The command sync; echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches:
sync: Flushes the filesystem buffers to ensure any pending writes are completed before cache clearing.
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches: Instructs the kernel to drop page cache (but not other caches like dentries or inodes).
Purpose: Frees up memory by dropping cached files that are no longer in use. This can improve performance in memory-constrained environments, though it is generally safe to let Linux manage the cache automatically.

3. Cleaning User Cache:
 ```bash
clean_user_cache() {
    echo "Cleaning user cache..."
    rm -rf ~/.cache/*
    echo "User cache cleaned."
}
```
This function deletes files inside the userâ€™s cache directory (~/.cache), which is commonly used by applications (e.g., web browsers) to store cache data.
The command rm -rf ~/.cache/*:
~/.cache/*: Refers to all files and directories inside the user's .cache folder.
Purpose: Removes cached data from user applications, potentially freeing up disk space and resolving issues caused by corrupted cache files.

4. Running All Cleaning Functions:
 ```bash
clean_temp_files
clean_system_cache
clean_user_cache
```
The script sequentially runs the three functions: cleaning temporary files, system cache, and user cache.
Purpose: The script ensures that all cleaning actions are executed in order, resulting in a comprehensive cleanup process.

5. Final Message:
 ```bash
echo "Cleanup complete."Displays a message to the user indicating that the cleanup process has finished.
```

## Use Cases:
1. Freeing Up Disk Space:
  Over time, temporary files, cached data, and system caches can consume a significant amount of disk space. This script is useful for reclaiming space, especially on systems with limited storage.

2. Improving System Performance:
  In systems with constrained memory or storage, regularly clearing the cache and removing unnecessary files can help improve overall system performance by freeing up resources.

3. Maintaining System Hygiene:
  Regular cleanup of temporary and cache files can prevent issues such as slow application performance or excessive disk usage. This script could be set to run periodically via cron to keep the system clean.

4. Troubleshooting:
  Sometimes, applications misbehave due to corrupted cache files. Clearing the user cache (e.g., browser cache or application-specific cache) can resolve such issues without having to uninstall or reset the app.

## Conclusion:

This Bash script provides an easy way to clean temporary files, system caches, and user caches in Linux environments. It is particularly useful for freeing up disk space, improving system performance, and resolving issues related to corrupted cache files. The script can be run manually or scheduled as part of regular system maintenance tasks.

5. [disk_space_alert.sh](Script/disk_space_alert.sh): This Bash script monitors the disk usage of the root partition and sends an email alert if it exceeds 80%. If the usage is below the threshold, it simply logs the current usage without sending an alert.

<details>
<summary>Analysis of the Bash Script</summary>
  
## Disk Space Monitoring and Email Alert
This Bash script monitors the disk usage of the root partition (/) on a Linux system and sends an email alert if the disk usage exceeds a specified threshold. Itâ€™s a useful script for system administrators who need to ensure that critical servers or systems donâ€™t run out of disk space. Below is a detailed explanation of how the script works and when it can be used.

## How the Script Works:

1. Set the Disk Usage Threshold:
 ```bash
THRESHOLD=80
```
The variable THRESHOLD is set to 80, meaning the script will trigger an alert if disk usage exceeds 80% of the total disk capacity.
Purpose: Allows the user to define a threshold for disk space usage. In this case, if usage goes above 80%, an email alert is triggered.

2. Email Settings:
 ```bash
TO_EMAIL="your_email@example.com"
SUBJECT="Disk Space Alert"
```
TO_EMAIL: The recipientâ€™s email address for the alert.
SUBJECT: The subject line of the email.
Purpose: Specifies who will receive the alert and what the subject of the email will be. The user can customize these values.

3. Get the Disk Usage of Root Partition:
 ```bash
DISK_USAGE=$(df / | grep / | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//g')
```
This line retrieves the current disk usage percentage for the root partition (/).
df /: Displays the disk space usage for the root partition.
grep /: Filters the line related to the root partition.
awk '{print $5}': Extracts the fifth column, which contains the disk usage percentage (e.g., "80%").
sed 's/%//g': Removes the percentage sign from the output, leaving just the numeric value (e.g., "80").
Purpose: The command calculates the current disk usage on the root partition, which will be compared against the threshold.

4. Check if Disk Usage Exceeds the Threshold:
 ```bash
if [ "$DISK_USAGE" -gt "$THRESHOLD" ]; then
```
This conditional statement checks if the disk usage percentage exceeds the threshold (80% in this case).
Purpose: Determines whether the system needs to trigger an alert based on the current disk usage.

5. Compose and Send the Email Alert:
 ```bash
BODY="Warning: Disk usage on root partition has reached ${DISK_USAGE}%. Please take action to free up space."

echo "$BODY" | mail -s "$SUBJECT" "$TO_EMAIL"
echo "Disk space warning email sent to $TO_EMAIL."
```
If the disk usage exceeds the threshold, the script creates a message body with a warning and includes the current disk usage percentage.
The mail command is used to send the email:
mail -s "$SUBJECT" "$TO_EMAIL": Sends an email with the specified subject and recipient using the email body created.
Purpose: The email notifies the administrator or user that the disk usage has reached a critical level and action is needed to free up space.

6. No Alert if Disk Usage is Under Control:
 ```bash
else
    echo "Disk usage is under control: ${DISK_USAGE}%"
fi
```
If the disk usage is below the threshold, the script simply outputs a message stating that disk usage is within acceptable limits.
Purpose: Provides a simple status update when no action is needed.

## Use Cases:

1. Monitoring Critical Servers:
  This script is ideal for monitoring disk usage on critical servers where running out of disk space could lead to system failures, application crashes, or data loss. By sending alerts    when disk space is low, administrators can take preventive actions before the system is impacted.

2. Automated Disk Space Alerts:
  The script can be scheduled using cron to run periodically (e.g., daily or hourly) to continuously monitor disk usage. This ensures that administrators are promptly informed when disk   space is running low, allowing them to respond quickly.

3. Preventing System Downtime:
  Low disk space can cause significant problems, especially on production servers. This script helps avoid downtime by alerting administrators before the situation becomes critical. For   example, web servers, databases, or application servers can all experience issues if disk space runs out.

4. Resource Management in Virtual Environments:
  In cloud or virtualized environments, disk space can be limited or allocated dynamically. This script helps manage resources more effectively by ensuring that disk usage stays within    safe limits.

## Conclusion:
This Bash script is a simple but effective tool for monitoring disk space usage on a Linux system. By sending email alerts when disk usage exceeds a defined threshold, the script helps administrators stay on top of resource management, prevent downtime, and ensure the smooth running of systems. It is particularly useful for environments where disk space is a critical resource, such as production servers or virtualized systems.
