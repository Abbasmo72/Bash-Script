# Bash-Script

Bash scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks in Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS. A Bash script is essentially a sequence of commands written in the Bash shell, saved in a file with a .sh extension, that can be executed to perform various tasks. These scripts help automate repetitive tasks, manage system operations, and simplify complex processes like file manipulation, system monitoring, and software installation.

Bash scripting is versatile and supports conditional statements (if-else), loops (for, while), functions, and variables, allowing developers to build complex workflows. It's often used in system administration for tasks like backups, managing log files, and user account handling. Additionally, scripts can interact with other programs and commands, making them useful for tasks like network management, disk usage monitoring, or package installation.

Since Bash is typically pre-installed on most Unix-based systems, it's widely accessible and used across various fields, from development and DevOps to cybersecurity. Writing Bash scripts requires knowledge of the command-line interface and the ability to combine commands logically. Itâ€™s an essential skill for anyone working in system administration or Linux environments.

## Getting Started

1. [linux_details.sh](linux_details.sh): This Bash script displays the number of online users, their access groups, the Linux version, and the system's uptime. It uses commands like who, groups, lsb_release, and uptime to gather and present this information in a readable format.
1. [check_internet.sh](check_internet.sh): This Bash script checks internet connectivity by pinging Google's server (google.com). If the ping is successful, it prints "You are connected to the internet"; otherwise, it prints "You are not connected to the internet."
1. [auto_ftp_upload.sh](auto_ftp_upload.sh):This script automates the process of uploading files from a local directory to a specified FTP server. It connects to the FTP server using the provided credentials, uploads all files from the local directory, and logs the process in a log file for tracking purposes.
